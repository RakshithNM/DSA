# Basic math problems
==============================
1. Two Sum:
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

2. Add Two Numbers:
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

3. Reverse Integer:
Reverse the digits of an integer.

4. Palindrome Number:
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome.

5. Roman to Integer:
Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.

6. Integer to Roman:
Convert an integer to a Roman numeral.

7. Valid Parentheses:
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

8. Count Primes:
Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

9. Excel Sheet Column Number:
Given a column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.

10. Fraction to Recurring Decimal:
Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

11. Power of Two:
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

12. Majority Element:
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.

13. Excel Sheet Column Title:
Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.

14. Square Root of Integer:
Implement int sqrt(int x).

15. Trapping Rain Water:
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

16. Pow(x, n):
Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n.

17. Rectangle Area:
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

18. Minimum Size Subarray Sum:
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum ≥ s.
